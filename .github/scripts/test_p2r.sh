# Setup environment and run unit tests for paper2remarkable
#
# After Travis effectively removed support for open source projects I've 
# decided to capture all testing facilities in a single script, to ensure we 
# can more easily move between CI providers.
#
# This script is intended to be run inside a virtual machine (or equivalent) 
# that runs Ubuntu Xenial. It will affect the system installed packages.
